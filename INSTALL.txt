Hacking HPPC-RT:
----------------
The project as a whole requires Java 8, although the final runtime jar is still Java 5 compatible. To assure such 
antiquated compatibility, some restrictions must be enforced:

* hppcrt (sources) : Runtime sources either templates or hand-coded can be up to Java 7 grammar, but have to use Java 5 API at best.
Then, the Retrolambda plugin translates Java <= 7 language constructs to 1.5 language ones, and finally
the strict 1.5 API compatibility is checked by the animal-sniffer plugin before building the runtime jar.

* hppcrt (tests): templates and hand-coded tests are allowed to be fully Java 8 compatible, APIs included.

* hppcrt-template-processor: allowed to be fully Java 8 compatible, APIs included.
* hppcrt-benchmarks: allowed to be fully Java 8 compatible, APIs included.


Maven shortcuts:
---------------

Note: While executing targets 'compile', 'test', 'package' 
Maven console ouputs #parse ERRORs by the logger 'org.slf4j.simpleLogger.log.TemplateProcessor.directive.import'. Those errors denote normal operation.

# Clean everything
mvn clean

# Generate Eclipse project files (the setup is a bit complex, so use this!)
mvn clean compile eclipse:clean eclipse:eclipse

# Compile 
mvn clean compile

# Compile all, run all unit tests
mvn clean test

# Build sources jar.
mvn source:jar

# Package all JAR files, builds the benchmarks jar, skip the tests execution.
mvn clean package -Pquick

# Compile all, run all unit tests, package all JAR files, builds the benchmarks jar, install packages in a local repository.
mvn clean install

# Compile all, package all JAR files, builds the benchmarks jar, skip the tests execution, install packages in a local repository.
mvn clean install -Pquick

# Try to resolve all dependencies to be able to work off the Net
mvn dependency:go-offline

# Use -Pquick to skip tests execution,
# and replace -Pquick by -Pquicknodoc to also skip Javadoc generation.

# Compile all, create benchmark JAR only
mvn clean package -Pquicknodoc -am -pl :hppcrt-benchmarks

# List available benchmarks
java -jar hppcrt-benchmarks/target/benchmarks.jar -l

# Run a particular benchmark:
java -cp hppcrt-benchmarks/target/benchmarks.jar com.carrotsearch.hppcrt.jmh.[benchmark class, see list above] --- --warmup=[nb of warmups] --measure=[nb of measures after warmups]

# Run a particular benchmark, with overriden @Param values. Add one of more arguments to the command line, such as:
param=value1,value2[...etc] 
where param is one of @Param name, with value1,value2,... overriding the alternatives hardcoded in benchmark code.
That way, @Param numbers can be changed, truncated, added, without recompiling. @Param enum values cannot be changed, 
but you can restrict the execution to a subset of the existing values, still without recompiling.

Ex: 
java -cp hppcrt-benchmarks/target/benchmarks.jar com.carrotsearch.hppcrt.jmh.BenchmarkHashMapPut --- --warmup=10 --measure=10 loadFactor=0.5,0.8 targetSize=1000000,2000000 implementation=HPPCRT_INT_INT,HPPC_INT_INT,HPPC_SCATTER_INT_INT
